A small project made using C# and XAML. It shows how basic pathfinding works where a mouse searches for a cheese piece in shortest time using the quickest path.The randomize obstacle button produces random maze where there are no cycles present produced by a modified cycle detection algorithm.

Run the MicroMouse.exe file within the bin/debug folder to execute the application.
